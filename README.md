# gwn

WIP

Like GitWeb, but Node

--------

## Why?

* What's wrong with GitWeb?
  * It's written in Perl which is great if you like Perl and not so great if you
    don't. Also it expects to be behind Apache.
* What's wrong with cgit?
  * It's written in C which is greate if you like C and not so great if you
    don't. Also it expects to be behind Apache.

I wanted a simple, read-only Git repository viewer written in a language I like.
I like a lot of languages, but I especially like working in Node.

[Klaus](https://github.com/jonashaag/klaus) is pretty close to what I was
looking for (small, read-only, simple, written in a pleasant language), but by
the time I found it I'd already decided to write my own.
